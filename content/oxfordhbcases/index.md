#### Digital Innovation and Transformation 


#### Behavioral Analytics 

Code: TLI 527[3 credit]  

Behavioral Analytics has been designed to provide a foundation of skills and tools that enable students to determine their own project topic, collect the data that they need, manipulate that data, and perform analysis consistent with their data. This is an experiential learning process that offers a great deal of flexibility with respect to the methods and tools used, and students are encouraged to create a final project in a manner consistent with publications within their discipline.

#### Research in Open Innovation 

Code: TLI 625 [3 credit]  

This is a research-oriented course designed for graduate students who aim to develop and implement a scientific research project in the field of open innovation. They will critically discuss and evaluate scientific writings relevant to the new research area of "open innovation" from the fields and disciplines of innovation studies, information systems, and other social sciences. Through synthesis of theories and frameworks used in academic articles, the students will develop a theoretically and practically motivated research question. They will also implement a pilot study to examine their hypotheses. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) in the Discovery Park at Purdue will offer opportunities to plan and implement individual questions, if students have not identified their own data source. In addition, the students will participate in an action-oriented research project in open innovation performed by the class as a group project to gain experience in experimental innovation research and practice.

#### Open Data Hacking

Code: TECH499 [3 credit]  
This is an experiential class. During this class, you will participate in Purdue IronHacks, a unique iterative civic hacking program. You will develop a mashup that integrates several data from data.gov into an interactive web-based application. For more information about Purdue IronHacks please visit www.ironhacks.com

#### Leading Innovation In Organizations

Code: TLI314 [3 credit]  

This course provides the foundation for understanding the manner in which companies capture innovation and use it to set themselves apart from competitors. Topics covered include the attributes of organizations that are successful in fostering a culture of innovation; the characteristics and roles of leaders and members in innovative organizations; managerial processes and organizational systems that facilitate the successful development, commercialization, and adoption of innovative technologies, products, and services; and methods used to measure innovation-related outcomes. Offered this Spring.

#### Blockchain Networks and People: An Intro

Code: TECH 58100-PHIL 58000A [1 credit]  

This course provides an introduction to blockchain technology and discusses contemporary research in the field. The learning objectives are 1) gain an understanding of the basics of blockchain technology, 2) identify different theoretical approaches to the field including network, economic, and social theory, 3) learn structured research methods to apply to the review analysis of scientific literature, 4) lead a research discussion on these topics, and 5) develop and articulate your own theoretically and practically motivated research questions.

Offered in: Fall 2018
