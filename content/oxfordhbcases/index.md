#### Huawei partnership for IoT cellular services (mode 2)
This case discusses the partnership between Huawei and its partners including Texas Instruments, Motorola, IBM, Intel, Altera, Qualcomm, Infineon, and Microsoft to develop Internet of Things (IoT) cellular solutions (Narsalay et al., 2016g). The R&D problem was complex but Huawei was well aware of which actors to partner with. The case discusses the goal of that partnership, centrally “coordinated” by Huawei. The case illustrates the high set-up and coordination effort that Huawei had to carry out to make the partnership a success. It also highlights how Huawei resolved the challenge of handling opportunistic behavior that prevents knowledge sharing. So-called customer-driven problem-solving was essential for aligning interest by focusing the exchange of knowledge and information on the end-users and their benefits. The partnership enabled Huawei to launch its 4.5G technology, setting the path from LTE (Long-term evolution) – 3G – to 5G. 4.5G further increases data rates for better user experience and expands applications in vertical industries (The full case study is accessible [here](https://rcodi.org/oxfordhbcases/Huwai))
