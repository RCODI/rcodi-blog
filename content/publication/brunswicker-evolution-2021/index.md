abstract: 'In Open Source Software (OSS) communities, coordination happens based on
  artifact-mediated interactions among geographically dispersed individuals. Prior
  literature on OSS and software evolution argues that that the coordination structures
  that emerge from dyadic coordination relationships may emerge from endogenous non-random
  relational mechanisms. The objective of this research is to understand whether and
  how relational endogenous mechanisms predict the formation of coordination relationships
  in evolving networks of software developers. We implemented an Exponential Random
  Graph Model (p*) and studied the significance of antecedent factors of coordination
  patterns among software developers. Our empirical analysis encompasses five years
  of development activity between 2012 and 2016 involving 619 developers in Nova,
  one of the oldest packages in OpenStack. In contrast to other network formation
  process, we find evidence of non-linear rather than linear preferential attachment
  among software developers. Knowledge similarity of two developers also has a significantly
  positive effect on the formation of coordination relationships. Both mechanisms
  unfold differently over time: While non-linear preferential attachment explains
  the formation of coordination relationships across different evolutionary periods,
  does knowledge similarity only sustain its effect in the early stages of OSS coordination.
  Our findings contribute to the scholarship on OSS and online communities more broadly.'
