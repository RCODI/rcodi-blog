abstract: New visual similarity technology based on SSIM is developed as a tool for
  measuring visual similarities of multiple web applications of different sizes, which
  is the first technology model that targets web components of different sizes. This
  visual similarity technology  takes screenshots of the web applications in the background
  and  extracts the components needed for further study. For finding  visual similarities
  between different components on the web  applications, it is essential for the algorithms
  to be able to handle components of varying sizes, after components extractions have
  been performed by the visual similarity technology. This work  describes a new algorithmic
  implementation for the detection  of visual similarities of various web components
  developed. The new implementation extends upon the SSIM algorithm that  measure
  the visual similarity of images of similar sizes.  The program portrays successful
  detection of visually similar charts and maps of different sizes in the web applications.  This
  implementation greatly expands the possibilities to investigate  visual reuse between
  web applications' developers.
