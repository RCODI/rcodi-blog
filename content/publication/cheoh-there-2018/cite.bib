 abstract = {New visual similarity technology based on SSIM is developed as a
tool for measuring visual similarities of multiple web applications
of different sizes, which is the first technology model that targets
web components of different sizes. This visual similarity technology 
takes screenshots of the web applications in the background and 
extracts the components needed for further study. For finding 
visual similarities between different components on the web 
applications, it is essential for the algorithms to be able to handle
components of varying sizes, after components extractions have
been performed by the visual similarity technology. This work 
describes a new algorithmic implementation for the detection  of visual similarities of various web components developed. The
new implementation extends upon the SSIM algorithm that 
measure the visual similarity of images of similar sizes. 
The program portrays successful detection of visually similar
charts and maps of different sizes in the web applications. 
This implementation greatly expands the possibilities to investigate 
visual reuse between web applications' developers.},
