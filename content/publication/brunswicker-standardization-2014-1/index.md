abstract: Formal de jure Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) coordinate the
  development of compatibility standards that ensure technological progress and welfare
  through interoperability. Informal SDOs, which are self-organized and not mandated
  by law, co-exist with formal SDOs to develop compatibility standards in a substituting
  or complementing way. As a result, the process of standardization evolves within
  and across multiple SDOs. An examination of the process of managing standardization
  across collaborating formal and informal SDOs can fundamentally change our theoretical
  understanding of governance of standardization. Drawing upon the tensions-based
  view, we argue that fundamental characteristics of the co-existence of complementary
  standardization are dynamic and contradictory. To balance such tensions, generative
  responses within and across formal and informal SDOs are required. This two-staged
  case study research examines the emergence of five tensions throughout the collaboration
  of two SDOs, HL7 and ISO, in health informatics. Our results explain the contradictory
  nature of five tensions with respect to (1) technological functions, (2) legal purview
  and geographic scope, (3) trigger, (4) time, and (5) usage/IPR and how they evolve
  over time. We also empirically derive three governance responses to such tensions,
  namely dynamic and multi-level roles, dynamic processes, and evolving resources;
  these responses allow members of the SDOs to respond to these tensions in a way
  that succeeds in managing the process of standardization. This research provides
  a novel theoretical understanding of governance of standardization for innovation.
  We conclude with recommendations for policy makers and standards developers.
