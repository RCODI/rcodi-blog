abstract: Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of project-level external
  knowledge search breadth and search depth on the innovation performance of open
  innovation (OI) projects in large firms; it further considers these effects mediated
  by two forms of control mechanisms (process and outcome control) when the level
  of project complexity and the two stages of a project – early (problem definition)
  and late (solution development) – are taken into account. Design/methodology/approach
  Based on a survey of 187 managers responsible for an OI project, the authors use
  theory on behavioral-based control mechanisms to explore whether the effect of external
  knowledge search breadth and depth on OI performance is contingent on having the
  right levels of control mechanisms in place. Findings The results showed that the
  control mechanism mediates the relationship between external knowledge search breadth
  and depth and OI project performance. Furthermore, project complexity is an important
  moderator of these effects, especially for outcome control. Originality/value A
  better OI project’s performance is not achieved by external knowledge search breadth
  and depth alone, but by building process and outcome control mechanism on it to
  balance knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Furthermore, Outcome control is
  only helpful with less complex OI projects.
