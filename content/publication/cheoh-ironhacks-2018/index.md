abstract: New IronHacks software is developed as a tool for running multiphase hackathons,
  which is also the first tool developed to run hackathons in a tightly controlled
  environment. The IronHacks software is a user interface where participants create
  their solutions. It also acts as a hackathon manager that enables the footprints
  left by the solutions’ creators to be tracked down. To model the real-world reuse
  scenario that will lead to the development of a robust reuse model, advancing the
  current search engine in locating relevant source codes to be reused, it is essential
  for the experiments to be run in a tightly controlled environment where each participant
  is given the same set of tools to create their solutions on. This piece of work
  describes a novel graphical user interface design that enables treatment conditions
  to be manipulated and tractions to be captured for each group of solutions’ creators
  all on a standard environment. This program greatly expands the possibilities for
  researchers to extend the literature of reuse in the software engineering domain.
