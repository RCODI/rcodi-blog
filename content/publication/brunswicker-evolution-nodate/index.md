abstract: 'In complex Open Source Software (OSS) development projects, coordination
  structures emerge from dyadic code interactions of dispersed developers. Prior research
  uses methods of network science to understand the evolution of OSS developer coordination.
  In this paper, we examine how endogenous network properties predict the formation
  of OSS coordination structures. We specify an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*)
  to study the significance of two relational mechanisms: Preferential attachment
  and knowledge similarity. We empirically estimate our model using granular development
  data of 619 developers in Nova, one of the oldest projects of OpenStack, working
  on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016. We find statistical evidence of positive
  non-linear (rather than linear) preferential attachment which cause skewed distributions
  distinct from a power-law. Further, we show that knowledge similarity has a significantly
  positive effect. Non-linear preferential attachment explains the formation of developer
  relationships across long evolutionary periods but knowledge similarity impacts
  only early stages. Our findings contribute to literature on software evolution and
  management'
