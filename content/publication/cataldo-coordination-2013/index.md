abstract: The success of software development projects depends on carefully coordinating
  the effort of many individuals across the multiple stages of the development process.
  In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to
  reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system. Reducing technical
  dependencies, the theory argues, results in a reduction of work dependencies between
  teams developing interdependent modules. Although that research stream has been
  quite influential, it considers a static view of the problem of coordination in
  engineering activities. Building on a dynamic view of coordination, we studied the
  relationship between socio-technical congruence and software quality and development
  productivity. In order to investigate the generality of our findings, our analyses
  were performed on two large-scale projects from two companies with distinct characteristics
  in terms of product and process maturity. Our results revealed that the gaps between
  coordination requirements and the actual coordination activities carried out by
  the developers significantly increased software failures. Our analyses also showed
  that higher levels of congruence are associated with improved development productivity.
  Finally, our results showed the congruence between dependencies and coordinative
  actions is critical both in mature development settings as well as in novel and
  dynamic development contexts.
