abstract: 'The established stream of literature on design architectures argues that
  designers should aim for modular architecture in order increase the system’s technical
  performance by lowering the propagation costs of the system’s design: A system with
  a small stable “core”, a cycle of coupled parts of the system, and a large variable
  periphery reduce the risk of technical feature and increase opportunity for innovation.
  However, such a core-periphery view ignores the micro-level dependency structures
  that emerge in open collaboration when a large number of developers produce a complex
  technical system at distance, virtually, and outside of formal employment relationships.
  In this paper, we develop a theory of design network motifs that accounts for the
  smallest design dependencies in the system that emerge in situ. Informed by the
  network theoretical concept of a “motif”, we introduce design motifs as the smallest
  unit of design interdependencies in a system architecture and develop a theory of
  design network motifs describe each system’s ‘motif fingerprint’ and explains how
  certain motif patterns affect the performance of a system as a whole. We empirically
  examine our design network motif theory using architectural data of the Open Stack
  repository NOVA, consisting of 2359 files and 1545532 lines of code. We extract
  all potential design network motifs created by 872 developers for 5 years. Our results
  show that design network motifs offer a new way to explain hidden dependencies in
  complex system architectures. Surprisingly, it is not just cycling that significantly
  impact a system’s performance but instead, a “feed-forward loop” motif. Our results
  contribute to the literature on design architectures and open collaboration more
  broadly.'
