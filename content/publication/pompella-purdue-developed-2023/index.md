abstract: Talented data analysts went head-to-head last fall during Purdue’s IronHacks
  competition to predict unemployment claims across Indiana. Competitors used data
  provided by Purdue Polytechnic’s Department of Technology Leadership and Innovation
  alongside state government data. The winners’ predictive models displayed stunning
  accuracy.
