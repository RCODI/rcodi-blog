abstract: 'In their seminal theory on modularity in design, Baldwin and Clark (2000,
  Design Rules: The Power of Modularity. MIT Press) focus on the macro-level: They
  show that modularity limits the degree to which changes propagate throughout a complex
  system, as constituted by how interdependencies among all parts pattern into a nested
  design structure with shared parts at the top transmitting functionalities via central
  parts down to the bottom. In this paper, we shift the focus to the microlevel structures
  of interdependencies that reflect the local decisions of designers with limited
  rationality. Such decisions relate to five fundamental types of interdependence
  structures among three parts: the design motifs. Following Baldwin and Clark (2000,
  Design Rules: The Power of Modularity. MIT Press), we assume that value-seeking
  designers weigh costs and benefits when creating motifs. We develop a new design
  motif theory to understand the sources of macro-level modularity. We empirically
  explore this theory using a sample of more than 20,000 design structures of a complex
  software. We observe a stable, recurring design motif signature: high-value design
  motifs occur more frequently than low -alue ones because of each motifâ€™s idiosyncratic
  microstructure. The common resource motif occurs most frequently because of its
  low costs and benefits for reliability in design. The sequential loop motif holds
  a critical role: it offers unique benefits for innovating system functionalities,
  but when placed in the center, it inflates the propagation of changes. This explains
  why central rather than shared parts are a potential source of innovation at the
  expense of modularity. These findings contribute to the research and practice of
  modularity in design.'
