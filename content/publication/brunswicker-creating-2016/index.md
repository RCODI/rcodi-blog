abstract: Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has supported
  the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers
  and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software
  tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products
  like journal publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a
  platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations.
  The article’s main theoretical argument is that beyond an individual’s contribution
  efforts to these innovations, a new social structure affects his scientific recognition
  through citations of his tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory
  lens, we introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from
  the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who jointly work
  on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces among the community members
  in an analogy to Newton’s gravity concept. Our model represents such dependencies
  in a spatial autocorrelative model. We empirically estimate this model using data
  of the programming community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers
  have contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a programmer’s
  contributions to digital innovations may have positive effects, while the digital
  practice structure creates negative dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being
  surrounded by star performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling
  scientific impact needs to account for a scientist’s contribution to programming
  communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital work structures
  in which these contributions are embedded.
