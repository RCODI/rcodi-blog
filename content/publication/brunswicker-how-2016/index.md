abstract: There is a conundrum when a firm engages deeply with external sources in
  its open innovation projects. This conundrum is related to the simultaneous activities
  of knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting. Many studies about open innovation
  have focused on the role of legal formalization in the context of intellectual property
  (IP) control. But legal formalization around IP may not address more specific activities
  of the parties such as tacit knowledge of involved individuals that may lead to
  revealing too much knowledge. In this study, we introduce formality into the joint
  technology development process itself, an alternative form of formalization, to
  manage this conundrum. Moreover, we argue that as the firm attempts to solve more
  complex problems, the importance of the formal joint process increases. We test
  our argument based on a sample of 82 open innovation projects collected from large
  firms in the United States and Europe. Our results clearly indicate that to manage
  the conundrum of simultaneously engaging in knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting,
  formalizing the joint technology development process seems to have a positive effect
  on projects outcomes that gets stronger as the problem becomes complex. We contribute
  to external sourcing literature by suggesting that the process formalization may
  support the legal formalization of IP control to manage the knowledge sharing and
  protecting tension. Moreover, we make important theoretical contributions to literature
  regarding relational mechanisms in interorganizational collaborations through our
  assertion that the combination of formality and informality between the partners
  seems to be required to increase the likelihood of success of open innovation projects
  without the loss of critical intellectual property.
