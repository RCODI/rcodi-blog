abstract: 'The established stream of literature on design architectures argues that
  designers should aim for modular architecture in order increase the system’s technical
  performance by lowering the propagation costs of the system’s design: A system with
  a small stable “core”, a cycle of coupled parts of the system, and a large variable
  periphery reduce the risk of technical feature and increase opportunity for innovation.
  However, such a core-periphery view ignores the micro-level dependency structures
  that emerge in open collaboration when a large number of developers produce a complex
  technical system at distance, virtually, and outside of formal employment relationships.
  In this paper, we develop a theory of design network motifs that accounts for the
  smallest design dependencies in the system that emerge in situ. Informed by network
  theory, we introduce the concept of a design network motif to describe distinct
  patterns of design interdependencies within the smallest substructure of a system
  architecture. We develop a theory of design network motifs describe a system’s microstructure
  and explain how certain motif patterns affect the performance of a system as a whole.
  We empirically examine our design network motif theory using architectural data
  of the Open Stack repository NOVA, consisting of 2359 files and 1545532 lines of
  code. We extract all potential design network motifs created by 872 developers for
  5 years. Our results show that design network motifs offer a new way to explain
  hidden dependencies in complex system architectures. Surprisingly, it is not just
  cycling that significantly impact a system’s performance but instead, a “feed-forward
  loop” motif. Our results contribute to the literature on design architectures and
  open collaboration more broadly.\"'
