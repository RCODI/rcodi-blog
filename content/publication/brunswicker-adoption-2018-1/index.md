abstract: OVERVIEWWe present a large-sample survey of open innovation adoption and
  management in large firms, a follow-up to a previous study. We repeat some of the
  survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to
  be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation
  is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers
  of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection
  for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at
  the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and
  out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition
  to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges
  and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.
