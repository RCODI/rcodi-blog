abstract: PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is one of two large
  scale international comparative projects of student assessment that now exert considerable
  influence upon school science education policy, the other being TIMSS (Trends in
  International Mathematics and Science Study). This paper focuses on PISA, now the
  most influential study. This article outlines the origins of PISA, identifies some
  of the challenges in its construction and the claims made for it. It argues that
  while the statistical and methodological aspects of PISA have received much research
  attention, other elements of PISA have been largely ignored. In particular, there
  are several outcomes of PISA testing that point towards a significant research agenda.
  In addition, the political, ideological and economic assumptions underpinning the
  PISA project have implications for school science curriculum policy that deserve
  closer scrutiny and debate.
