abstract: 'Civic challenges such as urban mobility and energy problems offer new corporate
  innovation opportunities. However, such challenges are wicked and difficult to tame.
  They require novel solutions that account for and integrate contradictory perspectives
  within the local innovation ecosystem of firms, governments, and citizens. This
  article presents a successful civic innovation crowdsourcing project case study,
  in which multinational firm Bombardier encouraged a global civic crowd to co-create
  visionary solutions to the challenge of future mobility in crowded cities around
  the world. Bombardier recruited a global crowd of 900 individuals and facilitated
  the citizen development of more than 215 solutions of unique firm value. We explore
  the process and outcome of this crowdsourcing project and derive actionable design
  principles for a three-phased civic innovation crowdsourcing process including:
  (1) crowd construction, (2) crowd knowledge acquisition, and (3) crowd knowledge
  assimilation. This process enables the crowd to integrate membersâ€™ diverse and contradictory
  knowledge proactively at both the team and individual levels. Additionally, the
  crowd is able to balance extension of existing local solutions and exploration of
  path-breaking technologies and solution concepts.'
