abstract: 'There is a controversial discussion on the role of transparency in open
  data contests. Existing designs of open data contests adopt transparency in different
  ways and report positive and negative implications for the innovation productivity
  of the contest contributors. This paper studies the role of transparency as an essential
  socio-technical design principle of open data contest platforms. It proposes two
  design features of transparency, namely performance transparency and solution transparency
  that allow the crowd to develop novel open data applications by integrating entrepreneurial
  experimentation with re-use for innovation. Adopting a design science method, we
  develop and test an open data contest platform design that jointly affords performance
  and solution transparency. Our pilot study of an open data mash-up hackathon provides
  evidence that these transparency features trigger both independent path creation
  and re-use for innovation. The result also shows mere copying will not result in
  good performance. Key Words: Performance transparency, Solution transparency, Technology
  Similarity, Code Reuse, Path Creation, Open Data Contests'
