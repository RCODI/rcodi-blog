Hi! I am Arushi Uppal, an Adobe Research Scholar. My research interests lie at the intersection of ML/NLP and HCI.

I am passionate about solving challenging problems in AI for accessibility (healthcare). Also, another problem is not whether we can create intelligent systems rather can we safely utilize them? I intend to use my skills and creativity to contribute building Responsible AI.
