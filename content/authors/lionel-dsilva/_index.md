I'm a Data Scientist, and former Airport Ops specialist; and my areas of interest are Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, Generative Algorithms, and Cloud and Distributed Systems. I will be starting my PhD at Purdue in the Fall of 2023, and am very active on LinkedIn and Instagram.
I also build track/street cars!
