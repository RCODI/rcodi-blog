## Simulating Performance of DoD Contracts
 is a collaborative project where RCODI works alongside Software Factory Labs (SFL) to conduct research concerning engagement and performance of R&D contacts. With government contracting, there are different-sized businesses that typically aply for contracts, and small business enagement can be raised. DARPA solicited for a means to address the lack of small businesses within government contract applicants. RCODI and SFL are currently exploring the reasons behind such a limited workforce with the hopes of enabling more small business participation within government contracting.

The collaboration is currently on-going.
