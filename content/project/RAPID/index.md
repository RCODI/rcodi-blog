## RAPID
 is a collaborative project where RCODI works alongside Software Factory Labs (SFL) to conduct research concerning engagement and performance of R&D contacts. With government contracting, there are types of parties that are consistently applying and winning contracts. DARPA solicited the general public for a means to address the segmented competition within contracts, with the hopes of engaging more small businesses, opening the narrowly-perceived corridor for defense contract innovation.

RCODI and SFL are currently exploring the reasons behind such a limited workforce with the hopes of enabling more small business participation within government contracting.

The collaboration is currently on-going.
