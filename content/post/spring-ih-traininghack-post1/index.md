## Data science is something everyone should learn about.
That's why the Spring 2022 IronHacks Data Science Challenge opened up the 2022 Spring Training Hack! It is part of the IronHacks initiative to promote valuable data science education to people across the globe. For the past two years, IronHacks challenges have been focused on COVID-19. This hack is a training hack scheduled to last one week from start to finish. It's geared towards learning and preparing for data science challenges in the future and can provide participants with valuable data visualization and data science skills. If you are new to data science, IronHacks is offering an excellent opportunity for you to get hands-on experience with real data.


## About this Hack
 Your task is to predict the unemployment claims in Indiana in order to understand the COVID-19 impact and risk. We preprocessed very large, actual, and granular datasets from our partners.
