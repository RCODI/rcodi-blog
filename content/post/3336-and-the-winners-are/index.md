RCODI held an IronHacks Awards Ceremony to recognize the amazing work accomplished by 27 Purdue students.
On Monday December 4, 2017, RCODI held an IronHacks Awards Ceremony to recognize the amazing work accomplished by 27 students across Purdue campus of creating an app that would solve the civic challenge of “Find me a safe and affordable place to rent near New York University – Stern School of Business.” Purdue IronHackers were greeted and congratulated by our special guests, Mayor John Dennis, West Lafayette, Robert F. Cox, Ph.D, Professor and Senior Associate Dean for Purdue Globalization, Brendan O Connor, Assistant Chief of Staff of the Management Performance Hub (MPH), and Sabine Brunswicker, PhD, Professor, Director of Purdue’s  Research Center for Open Digital Innovation, and the creator of IronHacks. And the top 3 winners were… EMILY KO: Best Community Spirit (contributed the most to the forum) JORDAN LOESER: Best Winning Spirit (performed in the top 25% of each round) JUSTIN MAMARIL: Best Solution (contributed the most to the forum) While these winners walked off with winning certificates, Amazon gift cards valued up to $500, internship possibilities with key sponsors including RedHat, Socrata, and MPH, the chance to go to La Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota where Purdue IronHacks is also established for an internship, and so much more, all the students received cool swag and participant certificates. IronHacks is an exciting software coding program that is offered each semester. So, register today! for next Spring 2018 IronHacks class: Tech499. Though the highlight of the ceremony was the awarding of the top 3 winners, Dr. Robert F. Cox reminded all the students that even though they might not have won, all are winners because “We’re all Boilermakers!” Boiler up! Congratulations to all! no-repeat;center top;;
