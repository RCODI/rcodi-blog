## Apply for Post-doctoral Fellowship in AI-human partnership and human-robot modeling in emergency response: Deadline November 1, 2023

RCODI and its collaborators at Purdue are looking for outstanding candidates for the [Gilbreth Postdoctoral Fellowships at Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Research/GilbrethFellowships#about) in the area of **AI and Human Parternership Modeling in Emergency Response**.The fellowship is awarded in memory of Dr. Lillian Moller Gilbreth, Professor at Purdue from 1935-1948 and a world-renowned pioneer in the application of psychology to industrial engineering. 
Position topic: AI and Human Partnership Modeling in Emergency Dispatch

**Description**:
When emergencies like wildfires or hurricanes happen, fast and targeted responses with dispatching and relocation of rescue teams, helicopters, or UVAs are needed. New emergency response technologies make use of advancements in AI (including ML and autonomous systems) to increase the success of targeted dispatching. Meanwhile, with the ability to trace emergency-related data at scale, digital twins offer new ways to prepare for future emergency responses in the “virtual” but “very real” representation of distinct emergency response systems. However, given the complex socio-technical nature and social dynamics in emergency response decision-making, it is important to consider the “human-in-the-loop” and optimize the collaboration between AI and humans. This post-doctoral interdisciplinary research project aims to develop new theories, models, and technologies that advance science on modeling human-in-the-loop AI and translate it into emergency response practice. The project team will advance existing emergency response systems with the help of AI/ML and digital twin technologies, and perform large-scale AI-human partnership experiments with the goal to optimize the decisions of humans in partnership with AI-decision support considering human biases, cognitive limitations, and social dynamics. The research will be performed in collaboration with industry partners and citizens. RCODI is particularly interested in recruiting candidates with a background in computational social science and an interest in UVAs and unmanned aviation for humanitarian aid and disaster management (e.g. firefighting). 

**Qualifications**: 
The ideal candidate holds a PhD in areas such as Computer Science, Computational Social Science, Complexity Science, Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering, or other Engineering disciplines, Management Sciences, Information Systems or Information Sciences.  We expect the candidate to be trained in statistical methods, data science, ML/AI or even computer vision, with the ability to mine and model large volumes of behavioral trace data or even physiological data (e.g. eye tracking, video, audio, heart rate etc.). Experience in agent-based modeling and network analytics (in particular network dynamics) is appreciated but not required. We would expect that irrespective of the candidate’s training he/she has a solid understanding of behavioral theories of social dynamics, team coordination, and/or human decision making under risk. Experience in performing large-scale human experiments (e.g. via online platforms) interfacing with digital technologies or experience in smart interface design and quantitative evaluation is a plus. 

**Advisors of Postdoctoral Researchers:** 

1. RCODI Director Dr. Sabine Brunswicker, Professor of Digital Innovation, Director of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation, Polytechnic Institute and Brian Lamb School of Communication. 
2. [Nan Kong](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BASO/people/Nan_Kong), Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Weldon of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University. 

**Potential external collaborator:**
