### Dr. Brunswicker Presents Research at SIT 
 
   Prof. Sabine Brunswicker recently presented work she conducted along with RCODI Fellow Prof. Mukherjee at Stevens Institute in Technology recently. Dr. Brunsiwcker and Dr. Mukherjee studied significance of preferential attachment and knowledge similarity to predict formation of open source software coordination strucutres through the use of an Exponential Random Graph Model and with data from 619 developers and 2,597 created and iterated Python files across four years. The developed model contributes to literature on software evolution and OSS.
