Our very own Master’s Student, Charles Song and his team placed 2nd last weekend in the first “Internet of Things Civic Hackathon” in Fishers, Indiana, run by AT&T and Code for America’s Indiana branch, [Open Indy Brigade](http://www.openindybrigade.com/). Using local open data to code mobile apps and hack hardware solutions to help better their community, Charles and his team developed a web application to predict crime in Indianapolis based on 911 dialing records from the Indianapolis Police. Charles was pleased with the outcome and said about the application: “Moving to a new area and picking the best place to live is a monumental decision for anybody and we wanted to make this decision easier for the citizen. Crime can tell you a lot about an area in terms of safety and comfort and this is the first step towards helping future Indianapolis citizens to feel safe in this fantastic city”. Congratulations, Charles and team, for your great effort and 2nd place!
