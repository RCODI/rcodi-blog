## Dr. Brunswicker investigates modeling the impact of governance on contractors
In this month's PPI announcements, it was revealed Dr. Brunswicker was awarded a research grant for simulating the impact of governance structures on small-medium enterprise participation in defense contracting. This research was spurred by Dr. Brunswicker's engagement with the Software Factory Labs, the principal inspector of the RAPID project: a DARPA-funded project engaged in identifiying properties that impact particiupation and performance within defense contracts. 

Congratulations, Dr. Brunswicker!
