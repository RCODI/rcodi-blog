Our director was selected as one of the panel track chairs of ICIS 2018!!!

To start of the new year with some exciting news: Our director Sabine Brunswicker is one of the co-chairs of the 2018 International Conference of Information Systems (ICIS) with the conference theme Bridging the Internet, People and Things. ICIS 2018 will be in San Francisco. She is one of the panel track chairs. The purpose of the panels in ICIS is to identify and explore emerging phenomena related to the theme of Bridging the Internet, People, and Things and to offer an opportunity to present further broader topics and ideas that are ground-breaking and perhaps controversial to the IS community.
