RCODI had the honor of welcoming Mr. Arden L. Bement, former NSF Director and Founding RCODI Advisor to the center today! Mr. Bement, Jr. met members of our team before leaving to deliver the prestigious Arden L. Bement Jr. Award to a fellow computer scientist; the most prestigious award Purdue bestows to scientists in pure and applied science and engineering.
