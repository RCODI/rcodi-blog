## A Purdue/PARI Collab with Windracers on Next-Gen AI enabled autonomous systems for UAV enabled logistics

### Dr. Sabine Brunswicker, Professor, Founding Director of RCODI and new Collab.

On May 24th, Purdue University began talks of collaboration with the UK based autonomous UAS solution provider, Windracers; on R&D and implementation of autonomous systems, led by Dr. Sabine Brunswicker.

Windracers Limited primarily focuses on air cargo transportation using high payload, fixed-wing UAVs with a high-reliability avionics system that was developed completely in-house. The company has extensive experience in operating fixed-wing platforms in the BVLOS context in the UK, and has an established safety case with the British CAA. Their newest ULTRA platform has a range of 1,000 kilometres, a payload of over 100 kilograms and an endurance of over 12 hours. The platform was also designed to be operated on unpaved surfaces, such as dirt, grass, and ice.

The proposed programme at Purdue University aims to establish a fellowship that will launch a unique research programme for the development of autonomous systems and AI/ML enabled aerial logistics. This implies a physical indoor and outdoor testing sites and designated air corridors for operations; including partnerships with federal and state entities.

This proposal is expected to have a positive impact on not only research within the UAS space, but is also expected to affect the workforce positively in the form of skill development.
