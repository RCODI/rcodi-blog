## Website specific instructions

**How to write a post**

To create a post, 

* You will need to create a folder with the post name and post date, e.g. `2022-01-01-title-of-post`. In the folder, create an index file, `index.md`. This is the link to the template [here](https://github.com/RCODI/rcodi-blog/blob/master/content/post/README.md). This is the template of an index file. Make sure to use the metadata correctly. 

* If you want to add a featured image at the top, you have to place the image in the folder, and it needs to be a PNG. The optimal size of the image is 720 ( width ) x 250 px ( height ).
