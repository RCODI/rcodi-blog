mentor in Purdue University and PhD advisor to-be, where functions predictions in our recommender
system is achieved by using neural nets on sentiment classifier to classify data. Inspired by the eminent
neural conversational model built by Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le in Cornell University, we incorporated the
‘sequence to sequence’ model when training our coding bot. Exploiting properties of neural nets, our new
approach provides guarantees on the accuracy of the results as neural nets don’t analyze text, which is
the functions wrote by programmers, at face value unlike the traditional approach that dissects the texts
into smaller tokens, counts the number of times each token shows up and utilizes the ‘bag of words’
model, which is commonly called the ‘dictionary’ to compute the overall subjectivity of the text with the
subjectivity of each word pre-recorded. Our new approach, however, will train the classifier and the given
new function will be classified in a different category. Based on the theory of ‘sequence to sequence’
model, I will introduce the concept of representing different recurrent neural network in function
predictions with different sets of parameters each, where the function is given few data points to learn
from the hidden previous function and also the current function. Our model not only learns from the data
injected by programmers but how it learns before. When predicting sequences of functions by converting
text to vector or numerical representations, we not only predict based on the previous functions but all
the functions that came before it by estimating the probability of certain contexts and learning a
similarity function where the reply to the programmer is one of the elements in a predefined pool of
possible answers. This ability to mimic programmers’ thoughts lead to a more efficient coding process
where programmers just have to describe what they want to do to the coding bot to have the relevant
functions inserted for them into their software applications.},

	abstract = {New visual similarity technology based on SSIM is developed as a
 tool for measuring visual similarities of multiple web applications
 of different sizes, which is the first technology model that targets
 web components of different sizes. This visual similarity technology 
takes screenshots of the web applications in the background and 
extracts the components needed for further study. For finding 
visual similarities between different components on the web 
applications, it is essential for the algorithms to be able to handle
 components of varying sizes, after components extractions have
 been performed by the visual similarity technology. This work 
describes a new algorithmic implementation for the detection  of visual similarities of various web components developed. The
 new implementation extends upon the SSIM algorithm that 
measure the visual similarity of images of similar sizes. 
The program portrays successful detection of visually similar
 charts and maps of different sizes in the web applications. 
This implementation greatly expands the possibilities to investigate 
visual reuse between web applications' developers.},

To model the real-world reuse scenario that will lead to the development of a robust reuse model, advancing the current search engine in locating relevant source codes to be reused, it is essential for the experiments to be run in a tightly controlled environment where each participant is given the same set of tools to create their solutions on. This piece of work describes a novel graphical user interface design that enables treatment conditions to be manipulated and tractions to be captured for each group of solutions’ creators all on a standard environment.

	abstract = {Along with environmental awareness, the interdisciplinary field of eco-feedback has become an active research interest in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computing, and Sustainable Design. While designers face the challenge of designing complex socio-technical systems (Norman and Stappers 2015), eco-feedback lacks comprehensive theoretical contributions to guide such efforts. This paper followed the PRISMA-P structured review method and reports on mostly empirical papers (N=36) on eco-feedback design from the past decade (2006-2016). The aim was to systematize the emerging field by classifying feedback types according to their impact on end users and identify theoretical grounding. Through our deep inductive engagement with the studies, we present four eco-feedback affordances: (1) Inform for awareness change; (2) Incentivize for motivation change; (3) Educate for behavioral change; and (4) Control for convenience. Current research is corroborating empirical evidence in support of eco-feedback, but their lack of theoretical grounding has resulted in incomparable constructs and inconsistent results.},

We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.},

In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system. Reducing technical dependencies, the theory argues, results in a reduction of work dependencies between teams developing interdependent modules. Although that research stream has been quite influential, it considers a static view of the problem of coordination in engineering activities. Building on a dynamic view of coordination, we studied the relationship between socio-technical congruence and software quality and development productivity. In order to investigate the generality of our findings, our analyses were performed on two large-scale projects from two companies with distinct characteristics in terms of product and process maturity. Our results revealed that the gaps between coordination requirements and the actual coordination activities carried out by the developers significantly increased software failures. Our analyses also showed that higher levels of congruence are associated with improved development productivity. Finally, our results showed the congruence between dependencies and coordinative actions is critical both in mature development settings as well as in novel and dynamic development contexts.},

	abstract = {There is a controversial discussion on the role of transparency in open data contests. Existing designs of open data contests adopt transparency in different ways and report positive and negative implications for the innovation productivity of the contest contributors. This paper studies the role of transparency as an essential socio-technical design principle of open data contest platforms. It proposes two design features of transparency, namely performance transparency and solution transparency that allow the crowd to develop novel open data applications by integrating entrepreneurial experimentation with re-use for innovation. Adopting a design science method, we develop and test an open data contest platform design that jointly affords performance and solution transparency. Our pilot study of an open data mash-up hackathon provides evidence that these transparency features trigger both independent path creation and re-use for innovation. The result also shows mere copying will not result in good performance.
Key Words: Performance transparency, Solution transparency, Technology Similarity, Code Reuse, Path Creation, Open Data Contests},

	abstract = {There is a conundrum when a firm engages deeply with external sources in its open innovation projects. This conundrum is related to the simultaneous activities of knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting. Many studies about open innovation have focused on the role of legal formalization in the context of intellectual property (IP) control. But legal formalization around IP may not address more specific activities of the parties such as tacit knowledge of involved individuals that may lead to revealing too much knowledge. In this study, we introduce formality into the joint technology development process itself, an alternative form of formalization, to manage this conundrum. Moreover, we argue that as the firm attempts to solve more complex problems, the importance of the formal joint process increases. We test our argument based on a sample of 82 open innovation projects collected from large firms in the United States and Europe. Our results clearly indicate that to manage the conundrum of simultaneously engaging in knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting, formalizing the joint technology development process seems to have a positive effect on projects outcomes that gets stronger as the problem becomes complex. We contribute to external sourcing literature by suggesting that the process formalization may support the legal formalization of IP control to manage the knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Moreover, we make important theoretical contributions to literature regarding relational mechanisms in interorganizational collaborations through our assertion that the combination of formality and informality between the partners seems to be required to increase the likelihood of success of open innovation projects without the loss of critical intellectual property.},

It argues that while the statistical and methodological aspects of PISA have received much research attention, other elements of PISA have been largely ignored. In particular, there are several outcomes of PISA testing that point towards a significant research agenda. In addition, the political, ideological and economic assumptions underpinning the PISA project have implications for school science curriculum policy that deserve closer scrutiny and debate.},

	abstract = {In their seminal theory on modularity in design, Baldwin and Clark (2000, Design Rules: The Power of Modularity. MIT Press) focus on the macro-level: They show that modularity limits the degree to which changes propagate throughout a complex system, as constituted by how interdependencies among all parts pattern into a nested design structure with shared parts at the top transmitting functionalities via central parts down to the bottom. In this paper, we shift the focus to the microlevel structures of interdependencies that reflect the local decisions of designers with limited rationality. Such decisions relate to five fundamental types of interdependence structures among three parts: the design motifs. Following Baldwin and Clark (2000, Design Rules: The Power of Modularity. MIT Press), we assume that value-seeking designers weigh costs and benefits when creating motifs. We develop a new design motif theory to understand the sources of macro-level modularity. We empirically explore this theory using a sample of more than 20,000 design structures of a complex software. We observe a stable, recurring design motif signature: high-value design motifs occur more frequently than low -alue ones because of each motif’s idiosyncratic microstructure. The common resource motif occurs most frequently because of its low costs and benefits for reliability in design. The sequential loop motif holds a critical role: it offers unique benefits for innovating system functionalities, but when placed in the center, it inflates the propagation of changes. This explains why central rather than shared parts are a potential source of innovation at the expense of modularity. These findings contribute to the research and practice of modularity in design.},

	abstract = {In Open Source Software (OSS) communities, coordination happens based on artifact-mediated interactions among geographically dispersed individuals. Prior literature on OSS and software evolution argues that that the coordination structures that emerge from dyadic coordination relationships may emerge from endogenous non-random relational mechanisms. The objective of this research is to understand whether and how relational endogenous mechanisms predict the formation of coordination relationships in evolving networks of software developers. We implemented an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) and studied the significance of antecedent factors of coordination patterns among software developers. Our empirical analysis encompasses five years of development activity between 2012 and 2016 involving 619 developers in Nova, one of the oldest packages in OpenStack. In contrast to other network formation process, we find evidence of non-linear rather than linear preferential attachment among software developers. Knowledge similarity of two developers also has a significantly positive effect on the formation of coordination relationships. Both mechanisms unfold differently over time: While non-linear preferential attachment explains the formation of coordination relationships across different evolutionary periods, does knowledge similarity only sustain its effect in the early stages of OSS coordination. Our findings contribute to the scholarship on OSS and online communities more broadly.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of project-level external knowledge search breadth and search depth on the innovation performance of open innovation (OI) projects in large firms; it further considers these effects mediated by two forms of control mechanisms (process and outcome control) when the level of project complexity and the two stages of a project – early (problem definition) and late (solution development) – are taken into account. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey of 187 managers responsible for an OI project, the authors use theory on behavioral-based control mechanisms to explore whether the effect of external knowledge search breadth and depth on OI performance is contingent on having the right levels of control mechanisms in place. Findings The results showed that the control mechanism mediates the relationship between external knowledge search breadth and depth and OI project performance. Furthermore, project complexity is an important moderator of these effects, especially for outcome control. Originality/value A better OI project’s performance is not achieved by external knowledge search breadth and depth alone, but by building process and outcome control mechanism on it to balance knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Furthermore, Outcome control is only helpful with less complex OI projects.},

	abstract = {Innovation is a cumulative process in which past knowledge created by others can be both a source for predictable outcomes and also a barrier to significant change. The recent literature on digital innovation suggests that open platforms, which encourage their developers to build upon each other's knowledge when innovating their add-on apps in the periphery, face a related paradox. Developers face the tension of either being coherent with the past, or flexible to adjust to the future. In this paper, we examine how the trade-off between coherent and flexible search mechanisms affects the individual developer's choice of innovating a certain app as well as his or her cumulative impact, i.e., the degree of modifications to the app. We study an open platform in the multi-disciplinary field of nanotechnology, in which 480 developers perform more than 30,000 problem-solving actions over a period of 10 years. We use relational event modeling to differentially assess the effect of the coherent and flexible search strategies. We find that developers are significantly more likely to choose a certain app that is consistent with both a coherent and flexible strategy. However, a coherent strategy leads to greater cumulative impact on an app compared to a strategy of being mutually coherent and flexible. Thus, our findings indicate both a complementary and a contradictory logic in how the tension between coherence and flexibility unfolds. We make contributions to the recent literature on digital innovation as well as the innovation literature more broadly. Further, our results inform innovation policy and platform design.},

	abstract = {Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations. The article’s main theoretical argument is that beyond an individual’s contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces among the community members in an analogy to Newton’s gravity concept. Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a programmer’s contributions to digital innovations may have positive effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific impact needs to account for a scientist’s contribution to programming communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital work structures in which these contributions are embedded.},

	abstract = {Civic challenges such as urban mobility and energy problems offer new corporate innovation opportunities. However, such challenges are wicked and difficult to tame. They require novel solutions that account for and integrate contradictory perspectives within the local innovation ecosystem of firms, governments, and citizens. This article presents a successful civic innovation crowdsourcing project case study, in which multinational firm Bombardier encouraged a global civic crowd to co-create visionary solutions to the challenge of future mobility in crowded cities around the world. Bombardier recruited a global crowd of 900 individuals and facilitated the citizen development of more than 215 solutions of unique firm value. We explore the process and outcome of this crowdsourcing project and derive actionable design principles for a three-phased civic innovation crowdsourcing process including: (1) crowd construction, (2) crowd knowledge acquisition, and (3) crowd knowledge assimilation. This process enables the crowd to integrate members’ diverse and contradictory knowledge proactively at both the team and individual levels. Additionally, the crowd is able to balance extension of existing local solutions and exploration of path-breaking technologies and solution concepts.},

	abstract = {The established stream of literature on design architectures argues that designers should aim for modular architecture in order increase the system’s technical performance by lowering the propagation costs of the system’s design: A system with a small stable “core”, a cycle of coupled parts of the system, and a large variable periphery reduce the risk of technical feature and increase opportunity for innovation. However, such a core-periphery view ignores the micro-level dependency structures that emerge in open collaboration when a large number of developers produce a complex technical system at distance, virtually, and outside of formal employment relationships. In this paper, we develop a theory of design network motifs that accounts for the smallest design dependencies in the system that emerge in situ. Informed by network theory, we introduce the concept of a design network motif to describe distinct patterns of design interdependencies within the smallest substructure of a system architecture. We develop a theory of design network motifs describe a system’s microstructure and explain how certain motif patterns affect the performance of a system as a whole. We empirically examine our design network motif theory using architectural data of the Open Stack repository NOVA, consisting of 2359 files and 1545532 lines of code. We extract all potential design network motifs created by 872 developers for 5 years. Our results show that design network motifs offer a new way to explain hidden dependencies in complex system architectures. Surprisingly, it is not just cycling that significantly impact a system’s performance but instead, a “feed-forward loop” motif. Our results contribute to the literature on design architectures and open collaboration more broadly."},

	abstract = {Formal de jure Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) coordinate the development of compatibility standards that ensure technological progress and welfare through interoperability. Informal SDOs, which are self-organized and not mandated by law, co-exist with formal SDOs to develop compatibility standards in a substituting or complementing way. As a result, the process of standardization evolves within and across multiple SDOs. An examination of the process of managing standardization across collaborating formal and informal SDOs can fundamentally change our theoretical understanding of governance of standardization. Drawing upon the tensions-based view, we argue that fundamental characteristics of the co-existence of complementary standardization are dynamic and contradictory. To balance such tensions, generative responses within and across formal and informal SDOs are required. This two-staged case study research examines the emergence of five tensions throughout the collaboration of two SDOs, HL7 and ISO, in health informatics. Our results explain the contradictory nature of five tensions with respect to (1) technological functions, (2) legal purview and geographic scope, (3) trigger, (4) time, and (5) usage/IPR and how they evolve over time. We also empirically derive three governance responses to such tensions, namely dynamic and multi-level roles, dynamic processes, and evolving resources; these responses allow members of the SDOs to respond to these tensions in a way that succeeds in managing the process of standardization. This research provides a novel theoretical understanding of governance of standardization for innovation. We conclude with recommendations for policy makers and standards developers.},
